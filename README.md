Serverless URL Shortener on AWS with API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB and Python

## Demonstration

Tutorial on how to setup a serverless URL shortener has been published on [https://blog.ruanbekker.com/blog/2018/11/30/how-to-setup-a-serverless-url-shortener-with-api-gateway-lambda-and-dynamodb-on-aws/](https://blog.ruanbekker.com/blog/2018/11/30/how-to-setup-a-serverless-url-shortener-with-api-gateway-lambda-and-dynamodb-on-aws/?referral=github.com)

## Todo

I've published a post on how to setup a Python Flask and Javascript UI thats avaialable here: [https://blog.ruanbekker.com/blog/2018/12/18/creating-a-ui-in-python-flask-and-bootstrap-for-our-serverless-url-shortener/](https://blog.ruanbekker.com/blog/2018/12/18/creating-a-ui-in-python-flask-and-bootstrap-for-our-serverless-url-shortener/?referral=github.com)

I will still look into making it more static with pure JS and hosting it on S3 to make it more serverless'ish
